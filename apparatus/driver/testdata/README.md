# Driver test data

## `tls/`: TEST-ONLY certificates and keys

These certificates and their **private keys are deliberately published**. They
exist only so the acceptance driver's fake Messages API can serve HTTPS on
loopback and through its CONNECT proxy. Nothing outside the driver may trust
them; the release binary never does (it trusts only the web PKI roots built into
it). The test build trusts `testonly-ca.pem` only when the driver passes it as
`STEWART_TEST_TLS_ROOT` (INTERFACE Appendix C.1).

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `testonly-ca.pem`, `.key` | The test CA, `CN=Stewart acceptance driver TEST-ONLY CA`. Its certificate is the file given as `STEWART_TEST_TLS_ROOT`. |
| `testonly-provider.pem`, `.key` | Server certificate issued by the test CA for `provider.test`, `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`: the fake provider's HTTPS identity, directly and behind the proxy. |
| `testonly-wrongname.pem`, `.key` | Issued by the test CA for `other.test` only: a name-mismatch control. |
| `testonly-expired.pem`, `.key` | Issued by the test CA for the right names, valid only during 2001: an expiry control. |
| `testonly-other-ca.pem`, `.key` | A second CA that is never given to the binary. |
| `testonly-untrusted.pem`, `.key` | Issued by the second CA for the right names: an untrusted-issuer control. |
| `VERSION`, `SHA256SUMS` | The OpenSSL version that made them and the files' digests. |

All keys are ECDSA P-256 in PKCS#8 PEM; the certificates are X.509 v3 with the
subject alternative names above, `serverAuth` extended key usage on the leaves,
and fixed validity from 2025-01-01 to 2125-01-01, so they work whatever the
container clock says.

They were made by [`make-tls.sh`](make-tls.sh), on 2026-10-30 with the OpenSSL
named in `tls/VERSION`:

```sh
sh apparatus/driver/testdata/make-tls.sh     # OpenSSL 3.4 or later (-not_before/-not_after)
```

The script regenerates every file (new keys, new serial numbers), checks that the
provider and wrong-name leaves verify against the test CA and that the untrusted
leaf does not, and writes `SHA256SUMS`. Regenerating changes nothing a case
depends on except the bytes; commit the new files together.
